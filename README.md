Unfortunately, there is no quick way to turn on power saving mode from the desktop on macOS, and as the owner of a Mac on M1, I really wanted to do this.
 
So I had the (perhaps strange) idea to write this program. The source code is in the public domain, and the program itself is far from elegant, as it requires a password and does the whole trick by opening a terminal.\n\nHowever, this does the job for me. Perhaps in the future, I would like to rewrite the program under Swift, but we'll see.

I hope this program will make your life a little easier

You can make an allias on desktop and use it quickly
